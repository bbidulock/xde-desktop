Preliminary Release 0.4
=======================

This is the fourth release of the xde-desktop package that provides a
desktop for the XDE (X Desktop Environment).

This release is a preliminary release: the package is not fully
functional yet.  The purpose of this release is to simply generate
better autoconf directory defaults and improve the build process some
more.

Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the package
from source.  See the [NEWS](NEWS) and [TODO](TODO) file in the release
for more information.  Please report problems to the issues list on
[GitHub](https://github.com/bbidulock/xde-desktop/issues).
