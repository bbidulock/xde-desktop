Preliminary Release 1.3
=======================

This is the third release of the xde-desktop package that provides a desktop
for the XDE (X Desktop Environment).

This release is a preliminary release: the package is not fully functional
yet.  The purpose of this release is to simply update the build system with a
better NEWS file, handle annotated tags, and perform lzip compression on the
tarball.

Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the release from
source.  See the [NEWS](NEWS) and [TODO](TODO) file in the release for more
information.  Please report problems to the issues list on github.
